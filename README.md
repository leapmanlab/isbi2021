# Bootstrapping 3D Electron Microscopy Segmentation Datasets

This repo contains the code used to train and deploy segmentation networks for the LCIMB, NIBIB, NIH submission to ISBI 2021: _Bootstrapping 3D Electron Microscopy Segmentation Datasets_ (link to come). 

The `isbi2021.py` file is the script used to train different network variants on different datasets, and can be modified by following the documentation inside the script. **TODO**: Improve that documentation.

The `src/segment.py` file can be used to segment a dataset using a network or ensemble of networks. **TODO**: Improve its user-friendliness.

Any questions can be directed to Dr. Matthew Guay at matt.d.guay@gmail.com.
